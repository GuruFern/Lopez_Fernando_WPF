//How much water do I need a day based on my weight and level of daily excercise
//Ask user for weight
//Ask user for amount of daily excercise
//Call function that has calculation

var excercise = prompt("How much excercise do you do a day in minutes?"); //Prompt user for daily excercise
var waterAmount = prompt("How much water do you dring in ounces per day?") //Prompt user for daily water consumption

	var weight = prompt("Awww, don't be shy. What is your current weight in pounds?"); //Prompt again and assign to weight variable
}

	var excercise = prompt("Don't be bashful. How often do you flex them muscles?"); //Prompt again and assign to excercise variable
}
